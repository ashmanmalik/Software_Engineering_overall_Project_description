class HexGrid:
    """
    This class represents a hexagonal grid of tiles, and has all methods
    required to support a game of Minesweeper, except for graphics support.
    Rendering is implemented separately in HexGridUIUtilities and in the other
    Tkinter-specific UI classes. This means that HexGrid is UI-agnostic and
    that other UI frameworks can be used without needing to modify this class.

    The hexagonal grid is stored in a 2-dimensional nested array.
    In the context of this class:
        - 'size' refers to the number of tiles in the topmost or bottommost row.
          All size and coordinate calculations are based on this number.
        - 'y' refers to the row of a specific tile, with
          y = 0 at the top and y = 2 * size - 2 at the bottom.
        - 'x' refers to the horizontal position of a tile. x = 0 always refers
          to the first tile in a given row. The highest x coordinate changes
          depending on the y coordinate, but it changes between size - 1 and
          2 * size - 2. Because x coordinates depend on y coordinates, the
          nested array used internally (called self.grid) stores coordinates
          y first and x second, i.e. self.grid[y][x]

    y coordinates in a hexagonal grid (size = 3):
       0 0 0
      1 1 1 1
     2 2 2 2 2
      3 3 3 3
       4 4 4

    x coordinates in a hexagonal grid (size = 3):
       0 1 2
      0 1 2 3
     0 1 2 3 4
      0 1 2 3
       0 1 2
    The 'bending' of the vertical lines is clearly visible in this diagram.

    Here we can also see that the centre tile is (size - 1, size - 1).
    This is used for the 'safe' tile in the difficulty selection window.

    This is how the number of cells in a row is calculated:
       0 0 0   count = size + 0 (size + y)
      1 1 1 1  count = size + 1 (size + y)
     2 2 2 2 2 count = size + 2 (size + y or size + (2 * size - 2) - y)
      3 3 3 3  count = size + 1 (size + (2 * size - 2) - y)
       4 4 4   count = size + 0 (size + (2 * size - 2) - y)

    In general: count = size + min(y, 2 * size - 2 - y)

    Finally, the total number of tiles in a
    hexagonal grid of size s is 3s^2 - 3s + 1.
    The highest possible mine count is 1 less than this.
